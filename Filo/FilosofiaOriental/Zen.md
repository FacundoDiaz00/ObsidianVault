#### 1. The Meaning of the Term _Zen_

The designation of this school of the Buddha-Way as _Zen_, which means sitting meditation, is derived from a transliteration of the Chinese word _Chán_. Because the Chinese term is in turn a transliteration of the Sanskrit term _dhyāna_, however, Zen owes its historical origin to early Indian Buddhism, where a deepened state of meditation, called _samādhi_, was singled out as one of the three components of study a Buddhist was required to master, the other two being an observation of ethical precepts (_sīla_) and an embodiment of nondiscriminatory wisdom (_prajñā_).

This is, Zen explains, because theoretical knowledge is a form of “language game” (Jpn.: _keron_; Skrt.: _prapañca_), i.e., discrimination through the use of language, constructed as it is at least in part on distinction-making.

Zen believes that theoretical reference _ultimately_ carries no existential meaning for emancipating a human being from his or her predicaments, for it maintains that discriminatory knowledge of any kind is delusory/illusory in nature. To this effect it holds that it is through a practical transformation of the psychophysiological constitution of one’s being that one prepares for embodying nondiscriminatory wisdom.
